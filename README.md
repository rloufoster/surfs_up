# surfs_up
Using SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Flask and Python in Jupyter Notebook to analyze climate data to guide in a surf shop investment decision making

## Purpose

### Investing in a North Shore Dream

 ![NorthShoreGraphic]()      

While visiting Oahu last year,  I had the idea to create a business that would allow me to live out my dream of living, and surging on Oahu permantently. A shop that would serve surfboards and ice cream to tourists.  I had some savings, but would need additional investors to get business off the ground.  I have put together a strong business plan and reached out to a successful surfing entrepreneur who is famous for his love of surfing, W. Avy.  However, W. Avy had previously invested in a surf shop that went under due to a lack of research in in the local climate patterns prior to the start up. W. Avy, therefore has asked that, along with my business plan, I put together a weather analysis of Oahu before he will agree to come "onboard"- no pun intenteded.






W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

### What You're Creating
This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You will submit the following:

Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis README.md.

### Resources:

Data File: hawaii.sqlite
Code libraries and packages: Matplotli 3.2.2, Python 3.9, Visual Studio Code 1.50.0, Anaconda 4.8.5, Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4, Pandas, Numpy, Sqlalchemy.


## Results

Bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in the weather between June an December


## Summary
